    "Surat al-Naba’ – The News: This Surat is critical of the Arab pagans who believed in one God yet worshipped idols and denied life after death. They failed to see the importance of this belief in ensuring a just and purposeful life on Earth. They couldn’t comprehend how the dead would be brought back to life. So, they are reminded of Allah’s creative power: vast landmass and oceans, lofty mountains, pairs of living things, the mysteries of sleep and nightfall and so on. The Day of Judgement will be the Day of Distinction. The Day when justice will be done and people will be rewarded according to how they lived. The final section beautifully captures the delights and pleasures of Paradise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Nazi‘at – The Snatchers: This Surat is about the Resurrection. The story of Pharaoh explains why people don’t believe. They are proud, selfish and love the world too much. The Surat opens with five oaths: war horses, winds, stars, the souls of the righteous, and the angels. The evidence leads to the conclusion, “You will certainly be resurrected.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat ‘Abasa – Frowning: One day, the Messenger ﷺ was preaching to the Makkan leaders hopeful they would accept his message. Abdullah ibn Umm-al Makhtum, a blind Muslim, came unexpectedly and interrupted, “Messenger! Teach me what Allah has taught you.” The Messenger ﷺ frowned at the blind man and turned away. The Surat commented on this incident, and thereafter the Messenger used to say, “You are the man for whom my Lord censured me.” The Quraysh were mistaken if they thought that Islam needed them. Instead, Islam appreciates sincere believers, like the blind man. The Surat also teaches respect and equality for people with disabilities. The next section highlights Allah’s blessings: life, food, and fertile land.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Takwir – The Shrouding: This Surat is about the truthfulness of the Majestic Quran and the validity of its teachings. It begins with the cataclysmic events prior to the Day of Resurrection. It validates the truthfulness of the Messenger ﷺ and the source of his message and describes the power, credibility and reliability of the Angel Jibreel. Finally, it challenges the reader, “So, where are you going?” (26).\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Infitar – The Cleaving: This Surat reveals the self-deception that turns a person away from Allah. After taking the oaths of the events leading to Judgement Day, it asks: “Humans, what has deceived and misled you from your generous Lord?” (6). The qualities of the Lord Who created everything are evoked to prick the conscience: you are monitored by the Angels who record your every move and on Judgement Day they will give a full account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Mutaffifeen – The Cheats: This Surat condemns cheating traders and dishonest shopkeepers. They are singled out since they have more opportunities to cheat and exploit the weak. Such injustices are committed by those who deny Judgment Day and feel they can do so without consequences. “Don’t they believe they will be resurrected on a Grand Day?” (4) This group is contrasted with people of faith and honesty, who will enjoy the delights of Paradise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Inshiqaq – The Splitting Open: This Surat shows the connection between actions and outcomes, a fact discernable in the world. An indirect disapproval of the Makkans, who refused to obey their Lord despite having intelligence. Working hard for one’s livelihood is a universal human value. But to limit life to this only is folly and so the workaholic is challenged. He is advised not to forget the Hereafter and the meeting with his Sustainer. However, those who work hard for their Hereafter are guaranteed progress, “You will develop stage by stage” (19).\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Buruj – The Constellations: This Surat marks the beginning of the second phase of the mission of the Prophet ﷺ, around the third year. It tells the story of the “diggers of the trench”, when the Yemeni King burnt the Christians of Najran in a trench. This story gave reassurance to the believers and warned the Quraysh, the persecutors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Tariq – The Night Visitor: This Surat is about the truthfulness of Judgement Day. After taking the oath of the shining stars, people are reminded, “There is a keeper over you” (4). Those who denied the Judgement Day are invited to reflect about their humble beginnings. Where do you come from? And “Where are we going?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-‘Ala – The Highest: This Surat explains how the Majestic Quran and the Messenger are reminders. The reference to the early Scriptures of Musa and Ibrahim verify the Quran as a continuation of the same mission. What blinds humanity to this reality? The love of worldly life. These verses express contempt for the love of the material world as it distracts people from their Lord.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Ghashiya – The Awe-inspiring Event: This Surat supports the three doctrines of Islam. The Day of Judgement is introduced in an unusual manner, “Has the news of the Overwhelming Event reached you?” Followed by a harrowing account of what will happen to the disbeliever who worked hard in his life but ignored Allah and forgot the Hereafter. In contrast, the believer worked to please his Lord. Humanity is invited to enjoy the delights of Paradise. Its elegant surroundings, its comfort and luxury. The price tag; faith.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Fajr – The Dawn: This Surat opens with oaths that remind us about the binary nature of creation and the oneness of Allah. The Surat points out how humans are unthankful to their Lord. At the slight loss of wealth or pain, they grumble and become impatient. They are sternly warned and told to renounce their bad habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Balad – The City: This Surat employs the metaphor of the steep mountainous track to describe the nature of Islam: a struggle, a jihad. Here Divine Dislike is expressed for people who are deceived by their strength and influence. Like the Makkan wrestler who thought no one had power over him, not even the angel of death. The Quran warns against such delusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Shams – The Sun: This Surat opens with ten oaths including the sun, the sky, the earth and the human soul. The verse “Then He inspired it to follow either it’s vice or virtue” (8) refers to the human soul. The Surat tells us that the human conscience can distinguish between right and wrong, between good and evil. Furthermore, the one who develops the moral values, spiritual beliefs and social norms will flourish and the one who disregards them will inevitably fail. The tribe of Thamud is presented as an example of those who failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Layl – The Night: This Surat explains the diversity in human endeavour and enterprise. However, the primary choice of confronting people is between good or evil and practising moral values. Good people are generous, mindful and appreciate the good. Consequently, “We shall soon make their work easy” (8). This is the Quranic hero. In contrast, the bad people are miserly, forgetful and the deniers of truth. For such a wretch, “We shall make his work hard” (10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Duha – The Morning Brightness: This Surat was revealed to reassure the Prophet. After a long pause in a revelation, he is given a four-point strategy to overcome stress and sorrow: get rid of negative thoughts, be determined that you will succeed, recall your past successes and set yourself clear targets. The powerful message it contains is an amazing force field of energy which, can heal our anxieties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Inshirah- The Expansion: This Surat builds on the previous Surat’s consolation of the Messenger ﷺ in an affectionate tone. The opening or the expansion of the chest of the Prophet ﷺ was a miracle that prepared him to be the receptacle of Divine Revelation. It expresses the incredibly elevated position of the Messenger ﷺ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Tin – The Fig: This Surat opens with four oaths of valuable trees and sacred places, splendid symbols, testimony to the truthfulness of its theme: the ‘inherent goodness’ of human nature, and how easily it can be tarnished. The reference to human nature being as the “most beautiful” (4), offers hope in a world ravaged by wars and human greed. But this “most beautiful” nature can be easily damaged. The concept of Judgement Day acts as a deterrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-‘Alaq – The Clot of Blood: This Surat was revealed in the cave of Hira. Here, in the stillness of the Mountain of Light, the Messenger ﷺ reflected on the waywardness of the Makkans. He loathed their idolatry, corrupt business practices and uncaring behaviour towards the poor. It was during a retreat that the Holy Spirit, Jibreel brought this first revelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat Al-Qadr – The Night of Destiny: This Surat commends the night on which the Majestic Quran was revealed. A night in the month of Ramadan when the Quran was transferred from the Protected Tablet in the upper heaven to the lower heaven. Then gradually revealed to the Messenger ﷺ over a period of twenty-three years. The angels, human destiny and peace descend this night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Bayyina – The Clear Proof: This Surat deals with the scepticism, resistance and disbelief of the idolaters, Jews and Christians. The Surat seeks to console the Prophet ﷺ and his followers that they need not be disappointed at such rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Zilzal – The Earthquake: This Surat talks of accountability on the Day of Resurrection. An earthquake will flatten the earth; mountains will turn to rubble, the seas will surge and the Earth will reveal its secrets. Yet the mindless person will have spent an entire life without a thought for the Hereafter. An authoritative reminder that on Judgement Day you must give an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-‘Adiyat – The War Horses: This Surat describes the unthankful nature of humans. The word Kufr, a key theme in the Quran. A Kafir is an unthankful person, who fails to acknowledge the gifts of the Generous Lord. Hell is the only place that will cleanse humanity of this sin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Qari‘a – The Sudden Calamity: This Surat asks a question about Judgement Day in order to open our eyes to its reality. Then describes its momentous events. The root of a successful life is good deeds and those who lack good deeds will have “a blazing fire” (11).\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Takathur – The competition for More and More: This Surat highlights human greed for material things. It attempts to shock us in order to awaken our spiritual faculties and make us appreciate that material wealth cannot save us from death. So, we must accept the Hereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Asr – The Age: This Surat has a pithy message: life is short and fleeting, so save yourself by believing, doing good works, be truthful and patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Humazah – The Faultfinder: This Surat condemns those with a negative attitude towards others, who continually search for faults and are obsessed with wealth. Hell is the only fitting place for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Fil – The Elephant: This Surat reminds us of how Allah takes care of his people and places. Abraha’s mighty army couldn’t harm Makkah or the sacred Kaaba. The Surat hints to the protective power of Allah.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat Al-Quraysh – The Tribe of Quraysh: This Surat highlights Allah’s favours: provision of our livelihood, security from danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat Al-Maun – Small Kindness: This Surat describes the person who is self-centred and heartless. He is incapable of even ‘small kindnesses’. He shows no concern for the needy and won’t even share his cooking pot! His worship is mere show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Kausar – The Abundance: This Surat is a masterpiece of eloquence and such a morale booster. You have so much to thank Allah for, so pray and make the sacrifice. The enemy can not harm you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat Al-Kafirun – The Disbelievers: This Surat teaches us to ‘never compromise our principles’ but accept differences of religion and freedom of speech wholeheartedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Nasr – The help: This Surat forecasts the Prophets mission is accomplished, victory imminent and hints to his demise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat Al-Lahab – The Flames: This Surat condemns Abu Lahab and his wife for insulting the Prophet ﷺ. Clearly showing that we must stand up for the truthful teachers and challenge their detractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Iklas – Sincere Faith: This Surat defines Tawhid, the oneness of Allah, the eternal, no one is like Him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Falaq – The Daybreak: This Surat is an antidote to the sources of physical and psychic harm. Allah will protect you from the harm of creatures, invisible dark forces, magic and jealousy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surat al-Nas – The People: This Surat teaches us to seek Allah’s protection against Satan.\n",
